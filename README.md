###Subset 0

* simple print statements (with explicit new lines)
* strings

[examples of subset 0](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/examples/0)

###Subset 1

* variables
* numeric constants
* arithmetic operators: + - * / % **

[examples of subset 1](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/examples/1)

###Subset 2

* logical operators: || && ! and or not
* comparison operators: <, <=, >, >=, <>, !=, ==
* bitwise operators: | ^ & << >> ~
* if, for, while statements
* last, next

###Subset 3

* simple use of
* more complex print statements (e.g. without new lines)
* simple uses of ++ & --
* ..
* chomp, split, join, ARGV

[examples of subset 3](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/examples/4)

###Subset 4

* <>
* . .=
* chomp
* variable interpolation
* simple uses of %
* arrays and hashes
* push, pop, shift, unshift, reverse
* simple use of regexes (// and s///)

[example of subset 4](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/examples/4)

###Subset 5

* anonymous variable ($_)
* open
* functions
* more complex uses of features from subsets 1-4
* self-application (translating itself to python)
* You may suggest in the forum other features to be added to the list for subset 5. Some features in subset 5 present great difficulties to translation perfect handling of these will not be required for full marks.

Not Included

The only features you need implement are described in the subsets above. If uncertain ask in the forum.
